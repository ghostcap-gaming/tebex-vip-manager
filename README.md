# Tebex Vip Manager - Tebex Sourcemod Plugin
A better Sourcemod plugin for Tebex.

Tebex is a payment platform for game servers that makes it easy for you to give out VIP and items to customers. By default it uses Rcon but this is not suitable for multiple servers. 

This plugin will check the Tebex API to see if their is a package attached to the customer. If there is then they are granted access to flags (Admin_Custom1 by default).

Please note this won't work with the inbuilt Tebex subscription system. Only the month by month system. 

We will be releasing our custom shop + subscription based Tebex plugins at a later date once we have finished testing and development.
